                        <p> Computational aided design, also known as CAD, is a very useful tool in engineering as it allows us to produce 3D models of a prototype that is to be manufactured or 3D-printed, for example. Whilst there are various CAD software that are also often similar, the one that I am most familiar with is 3DExperience as this has been used extensively for projects for my course at university. Here are some of the pieces from projects that involved CAD.

                            One of the major projects in term one involved producing a hypothetical, small low-cost electric vehicle (EV) within given constraints. This was a group project that spanned for one month. The tasks were divided within sub-groups, where each sub-group focused on producing CAD models of a specific part of the car. One of my team-mates and I focused on the rear assembly of the electric car, where we produced CAD designs of components such as the wishbone, the rear axle and the gearbox. Other sub-groups focused on the front and steering assembly and combining the front and rear assembly using a chassis.

                            Note: some of the elements such as the passenger seats, steering wheel and the tyres were imported from the GrabCAD library.
